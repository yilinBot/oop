-object is separate part of the data. 
				
		
2. Choose the correct statements about UML notation of objects.
	UML: 
		- data and opertaions are described by attributes and methods.
		- objects always have a state.
										-data and opertaions are described by type and specification.
										-objects always have a name. 
		
3. Choose the correct statements.

5. Choose the correct statements: 
								//- Foreach loop can be used instead of a standard for loop anytime.
